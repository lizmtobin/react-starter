<!-- This example shows how react updates the DOM. 
The DOM is updated every second with the current time. 
The input elements are read only and the value is set to the current time. 
The value is set to the current time by using the curly braces to interpolate the time variable. 
The time variable is set to the current time using the new Date() function. 
The new Date() function returns a new date object with the current date and time. 
The toLocaleTimeString() function is called on the date object to get the current time in a string format. 
The time variable is then set to the current time string. 
The time variable is then interpolated into the input element value.

As this is JSX, the input elements are self closing.
Only the time prop is updated and not the whole input element.
This is because the input element is not recreated every second.
The input element is only updated with the new time prop.
This is how react updates the DOM.
The input keeps the focus and the cursor position. very cool. -->
